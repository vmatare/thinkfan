thinkfan 0.7
============

1) Correction Values
--------------------
Temperatures that are perfectly fine for your CPU may already be dangerous for
most hard disks.

For simplicity's sake, thinkfan uses only the highest temperature found in the
system, but that'll most likely never be your harddisk. Thus you can now
specify a correction value for any sensor. This value is added to the actual
temperature and can be used to give that sensor a greater chance of being
considered in the fan speed decision.
I know this is quite an unintuitive way of handling this, but anything else
would have required a major redesign which would have resulted in much more
CPU usage in the main loop.

So please do check out the updated README and example configs, and modify your
config to keep thinkfan from slowly killing your harddisk :-/

2) Config Syntax
----------------
Thinkfan now has a shiny new (as in cheesy, but better than scanf) parser for
the config files. It was actually already used in 0.6.5. However in this
release it was changed to be much tighter on config syntax. In all previous
releases, it just skipped anything it didn't reconize. You could thus have
arbitrary garbage in your config file and thinkfan would just ignore it.
These times are over. Thinkfan now rejects anything that isn't a proper
statement or a comment. You can get the old behaviour back by using the -D
(DANGEROUS) option.
